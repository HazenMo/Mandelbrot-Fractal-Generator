# Overview
I really enjoyed creating this fractal generator using OpenGL. I learned a lot about fractals, but more importantly about using Visual Studio. I learned about making sure
I import the right libraries with the NuGet Package Mangaer.

I create a fractal generator that used a complex number class with overloaded operators to do the calculations for each pixel and showed the shape to the screen.

I actually originally wrote this software to learn about multi threading and though I did a bit of research I have not gotten that far along in the process yet.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio to develop this program. I actually super enjoyed coding in this IDE since it is really powerful, and has simple library pathing.
I used a number of libraries to implement OpenGL.

# Future Work
* Item 1 - I really want to get multi threading to work with this project.
* Item 2 - I want to make it possible to scroll and pan in the OpenGL window.
* Item 3 - I want to make the fractal more colorful.
